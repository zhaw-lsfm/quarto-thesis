# Getting started

To install the extension use the command:

```bash
quarto use template zhaw-lsfm/quarto-thesis
```

This will install the format extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your document. The example qmd will have the same name as the parent folder. For example, if your the parent folder is called PA2, the template will be named PA2.qmd. To preview a pdf version of this file, run:


```bash

quarto preview PA2.qmd


```
